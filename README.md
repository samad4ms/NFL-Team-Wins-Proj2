# NFL-Team-Wins-Proj2
Linear regression model designed to predict an NFL team's next year win total. Also includes EDA notebooks and web scrape scripts. This was my second project but first personal project during the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. 

The main files here are:
1) best_scape_nfl.ipynb<br>
This notebook contains all of the scripts and processes that I wrote in order to web-scrape several years of NFL team based statistics from various free online resources. 

2) NFL_EDA_1.ipynb<br>
Brief exploratory data analysis notebook used to analyise correlations, trends and the features I enginnered like net-points. 

3) FINAL_MODEL.ipynb<br>
As the file name suggests, this notebook contains the code for training and testing various linear regression models and includes the final model I used as well as the final metric (r squared and MAE) scores. 

4) NFL Presentaion.pdf<br>
These are the project slides I presented to my peers at Metis. 

The remaining files with 'prelim' in the filename are scratchpad notebooks I used along the way.
